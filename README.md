# png2ascii
A PNG to ASCII art converter written entirely from scratch in C.

This is currently HEAVILY a WIP and will not function as expected. Once it's closer to working, I'll shift to working primarily on a dev channel instead of main, but for now it's so new there's no expectation it will do anything.

If for some reason, you'd like to build and run this in such an uncompleted state, it should be really straightforward.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aur0rae/png2ascii
cd png2ascii/src
make

./png2ascii <file> <output width> <output height>
```
